## BeachProject

![Simulation](assets/video-gif.gif)

If you don't know Guarapari/ES - Brazil, it's the time to know. 

I made a simple project that the user can know de beaches of Enseada Azul,a part of our beatiful city - Guarapari/ES (Brazil).

By the way, it's not responsive build. So, if you want to fork it and apply the responsive codes, feel free. You can share it.

It was a test and simulation to build and practice my knowledges in some tools.

I used VsCode IDE, HTML, CSS, Typescript, Modules with Business Rules, Organization and a little of JavaScript
